This is Zijian Li, a PhD student at NAOC. My research primarily focuses on the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, with a specialized interest in multiwavelength AGN properties and galaxy evolution in the early universe.

Currently, I am working on the infrared regime of AGNs, leveraging the groundbreaking capabilities of JWST to uncover the secrets of X-ray AGNs. My work involves a wide range of observational data, from optical spectroscopy to infrared imagings.
I am proficient in astronomical data reduction and analysis. Beyond my home institution, I have been an active visitor at the CASSACA in Chile, fostering international collaborations in the astronomy community.

Outside of the world of galaxies and black holes, I find my balance through music and sports. I am a passionate explorer of diverse musical genres, which often serve as the soundtrack to my data reduction sessions. When I’m not behind a screen or at an observatory, you’ll likely find me on the field or in the gym—I believe that the discipline of sports perfectly complements the persistence required in scientific research.
